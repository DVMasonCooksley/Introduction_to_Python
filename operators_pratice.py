# why the assignment will fail?
# everything will work perfectly except for the last line (d = c + e)
# it will not work because nothing is assigned to e

# a = 1
# b = 2

# c = a + b
# d = c + e

#n = n + 1   this will not work because n is not assigned a value

#the following expression will work because n has been assigned a value
